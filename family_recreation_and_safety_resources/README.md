# Family, Recreation & Safety Resources 

The **Family, Recreation & Safety Resources (FRSR)** indicators represent community amenities and resources that support families, recreation, and safety. These indicators capture essential infrastructure contributing to family well-being, community support, and public safety.

## Indicators

- **Education Resources**  
  Institutions such as schools, colleges, and universities, identified using codes specific to educational facilities.

- **Food Stores**  
  Locations for food distribution, including grocery stores and food depots where residents can purchase food.

- **Recreation and Entertainment**  
  Places for sports, entertainment, and outdoor activities, such as parks, swimming pools, and amusement parks.

- **Police and Security Services**  
  Facilities providing police and security support, such as police stations.

- **Fire Protection Services**  
  Facilities like fire stations offering fire-related emergency assistance.

## Methodology

The FRSR indicators are derived through a structured approach involving **data collection, classification, and counting** across census tracts. 

### Data Collection and Classification
FRSR indicators are based on data from **DMTI Spatial**, which provides information on various community resources across Canada. Resources are categorized using **Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes**, which identify specific resource types such as education facilities, food stores, recreation facilities, and police/fire stations.  
This classification system ensures each point of interest is categorized into the appropriate FRSR resource type.

The data is provided by **Digital Map Technologies Inc. (DMTI)**, a Canadian company specializing in geospatial data and mapping solutions. DMTI delivers high-precision location-based datasets widely used in business, government, and academic research.

The raw data are accessible to any researcher at a university that holds a **Scholars GeoPortal license**.

### Counting Resources by Census Tract
For each census tract, the number of resources in each category (e.g., education facilities, food stores) is tallied.  
These counts provide the baseline measure for each type of family and/or safety resource within the census tract.
