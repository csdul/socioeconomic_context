# Node 3 - Socioeconomic Context

A suite of indicators of meso-level family-friendly community resources has been developed using [**DMTI Spatial’s CanMap enhanced points of interest (EPOI)**](https://www.dmtispatial.com/) with prior support from CIHR. [**Dr. Marisa Young**](https://www.marisa-young.com/) will lead this Node, expanding on that foundation by applying the theoretical and methodological work of **Bill Reimer** and collaborators, who measured area-based *“available social capital”* in rural Canadian communities[^1][^2] and classified it into four normative types: **market, bureaucratic, communal, and associative**[^3]. Standard Industry Classification (SIC) codes from CanMap will be applied to classify points of interest (e.g., churches as communal) into these categories of available social capital and examine their associations with population health.  

In addition, this Node will incorporate the [**Canadian Social Environment Typology (CanSET)**](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/17200002)[^4], developed through collaboration between UPHN and Statistics Canada’s Health Analysis Division. CanSET condenses a wide range of Census-based social variables into manageable groupings using hierarchical cluster analysis. Work on the **face and content validity** of these clusters has already been completed, and testing of their **predictive validity** is underway (e.g., associations with COVID-19 mortality[^5]). These CanSET clusters will be integrated to provide proxies for associative social capital.
