# Node 3 - Socioeconomic Context

A suite of indicators of meso-level family-friendly community resources has been developed using **DMTI Spatial’s CanMap enhanced points of interest (EPOI)** with prior support from CIHR. Building on this foundation, **Node 3** will expand the indicators by applying theoretical and methodological work by Reimer and collaborators, who measured area-based *“available social capital”* in rural Canadian communities¹ ² and classified it into four normative types: **market, bureaucratic, communal, and associative³**.  

Standard Industry Classification (SIC) codes from CanMap will be applied to classify points of interest (e.g., churches as communal) into these categories of available social capital and examine their associations with population health. In addition, Node 3 will incorporate the **Canadian Social Environment Typology (CanSET)⁴**, developed through collaboration between UPHN and Statistics Canada’s Health Analysis Division. CanSET condenses a wide range of Census-based social variables into manageable groupings using hierarchical cluster analysis. Face and content validation of these clusters has been completed, and predictive validity testing is underway (e.g., their association with COVID-19 mortality⁵). These CanSET clusters will be integrated to provide proxies for associative social capital.
