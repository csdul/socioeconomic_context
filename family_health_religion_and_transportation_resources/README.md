# Family, Health, Religion & Transportation Resources 

The **Family, Health, Religion & Transportation Resources (FHRTR)** represent community amenities and services that support everyday well-being, access to care, social connection, and mobility.

## Indicators

These include:

- **Family and social support services**  
  - Examples: child day care services, job training programs, individual and family service centres

- **Health care access points**  
  - Examples: primary care clinics, dentists, optometrists, mental health practitioners

- **Religious and cultural gathering sites**  
  - Examples: churches, temples, synagogues, spiritual community centres

- **Local and public transportation services**  
  - Examples: transit stations, local bus routes, school transportation

## Methodology

The FHRTR indicators are derived through a structured approach involving **data collection, classification, and counting** across census tracts. 

### Data Collection and Classification
FRSR indicators are based on data from **DMTI Spatial**, which provides information on various community resources across Canada. Resources are categorized using **Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes**, which identify specific resource types such as education facilities, food stores, recreation facilities, and police/fire stations.  
This classification system ensures each point of interest is categorized into the appropriate FRSR resource type.

The data is provided by **Digital Map Technologies Inc. (DMTI)**, a Canadian company specializing in geospatial data and mapping solutions. DMTI delivers high-precision location-based datasets widely used in business, government, and academic research.

The raw data are accessible to any researcher at a university that holds a **Scholars GeoPortal license**.

➡️ More information on **DMTI Spatial** and **SIC codes** can be found [here](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cis-sic.nsf/eng/home).

### Counting Resources by Census Tract
For each census tract, the number of resources in each category (e.g., education facilities, food stores) is tallied.  
These counts provide the baseline measure for each type of family and/or safety resource within the census tract.
